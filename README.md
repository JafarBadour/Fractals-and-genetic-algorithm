## How to run the project without having opencv 

* I have added an executable file to this repository "jafar" without quotes
All you have to do is to run the following command in your terminal
 ```./jafar PICTURE1NAME.EXTENSION  NUMBEROFGENERATIONS``` Where the first argument is the name of the picture on the working directory and
 the second argument is the number of generation to be calculated until you will write 
the output picture to ```Output.jpg```.

* Beware that you will be able to see the progress of the program via terminal
in such a way that every generation it will show you the maximum fitness number of the 
generation and number of this generation to be processed.

## How to run with opencv installed (when editing the code)

* You just have to make sure you have cmake installed and run similar commands that are 
available in this repository. 
* Then when the opencv is compiled everything will workout automatically
